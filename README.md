# LED Light Grid
This is a project I work on not-very-often. 

The idea is to make 8x8 grids of [LED lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZHB9M6A/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) into what I've been calling a "superpixel". This is a display element that can display a single letter on 64 individual light-pixels. It's useful to introduce this terminology because these grids are fixed and an effective unit of meaning.

Notes for next year / whenever I run this again / whoever uses this thing

You have to use sudo to run most of the python files that touch the light library.

The getvalues.py script is used for feeding in an image and displaying it on the light strip. This is a crappy name, and I should change it.
